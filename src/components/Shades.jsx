                <p className='mt-8'>I designed Shades to address the current needs of recent African immigrants who struggle to make friends, build a connection, and
                    start a relationship with people who look like them or like people like them and have similar interests. Shades is a passion project.

                    <p>As the sole Designer on this project, I wore several hats working as a UX Researcher, UX Designer, UX writer, and UI Designer to design the full user experience of the shades mobile app while also working with software tools like Figma, Figjam, Notion, and Google forms which helped me in every step of the design process. This project was done within a Two-week time-frame.</p>

                    <p>Socialization has become a struggle among migrating and immigrant Africans in the UK. Due to the demands of work, school, and
                        business, Africans in the UK have often found it difficult to meet with people of similar interests and build a connection or relationship to serve the emotional and relational part of their life. Shades aims to bridge the gap between this problem.</p>
